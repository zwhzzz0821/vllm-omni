"""MiniMax Music 3 pipeline topology: AR talker -> acoustic decoder.

Stage 0 ``minimax_music3_ar``: a Qwen3 backbone (the repo's ``language_model/``
subfolder is a plain ``Qwen3ForCausalLM``) plus a depth decoder, wrapped by a
class that owns its sampler. It emits 200-frame windows of frame hidden states
and the matching 8-codebook RVQ codes.

Stage 1 ``minimax_music3_acoustic``: flow-matching DiT plus DAV vocoder. Pure
compute, no KV cache, weights loaded from the repo's ``condition_encoder/``,
``transformer/`` and ``vocoder/`` subfolders. Output is 32 kHz stereo.

Classifier-free guidance is mandatory for this checkpoint: every request
decodes as a cond/uncond pair, and the uncond row is produced by
``prompt_expand_func``. The deploy YAMLs therefore carry
``default_sampling_params.extra_args`` with ``cfg_role`` and ``cfg_scale`` so
that ``has_sampling_extra_args`` is on for the stage and per-row extra args
reach the model's forward.
